# tspsolver-sa-ts
This application solves Traveling SalesMan Problem (TSP) using two meta-heuristic Simulated Annealing (SA) and Tabu Search (TS).
Term project of Selected Topics in Computer Science, King Saud Universty Course.

The tsp solver has 5 classes: 
         -----------> main:
                      where the program starts, the user will be asked which algorithm/neighborhood structure to solve tso with, then the search will start.
         -----------> simulatedAnnealing:
                      detailed implementation of the SA algorithm
         -----------> tabuSearch:
                      detailed implementation of the TS algorithm.
         -----------> TravelingSalesManProblem:
                      detailed implementation of the TSP.

The tsp solver has 2 folders:

        -----------> data:
                     contains the test bed used.
        -----------> results:
                     displays the figure of the convergence.
