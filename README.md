# Overview
This application solves Traveling SalesMan Problem (TSP) using two meta-heuristic Simulated Annealing (SA) and Tabu Search (TS).
Term project of Selected Topics in Computer Science, King Saud Universty Course.

# Details of implementation 
The tsp solver has 4 classes: 


         -----------> main:
                      where the program starts.
         -----------> simulatedAnnealing:
                      detailed implementation of the SA algorithm
         -----------> tabuSearch:
                      detailed implementation of the TS algorithm.
         -----------> TravelingSalesManProblem:
                      detailed implementation of the TSP.

The tsp solver has 2 folders:

        -----------> data:
                     contains the test bed used.
        -----------> results:
                     displays the figure of the convergence.
                     
 # Getting Started
 Test bed tsp_38.txt can be found in [Djibouti - 38 Cities](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html#DJ).
 
 To run the program, open `main.py` and choose your prefered algorithm/neighborhood structure.
